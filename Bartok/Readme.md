# Bartok
Bartok is a card game. At the start of the game every player receives cards and one is placed in the centre of a table (discard pile). Players take turns by putting card with the same suit or face value as one the top of the discard pile.
If player does not have such card he should take another one from the draw pile and end the turn. The winner is the one who would be the first with empty hands. Theree also other interesting rules but they are not programmed here.
Also at this version of the game there are 3 AI players and one human.
