# Prospector Solitaire
It is a card game. In the game you have to take all the cards from the table while draw pile has not ended. If it ends - game ends. The aim to take as many points as you can. It could be achieved by wining rounds and having big combos (combo is an amount of cards which you have taken without usage of the draw pile). Cards you from the table you could get if they are opened(some cards are closed by others) and they have adjacent face value.
